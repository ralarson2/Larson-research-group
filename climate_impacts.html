            Manure management contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane and nitrous oxide. Management choices across storage, treatment, and land application influence the magnitude and timing of these emissions.

        <h3>Key emission pathways</h3>
        <p>
          Methane emissions occur primarily under anaerobic conditions during storage and treatment, while nitrous oxide emissions are associated with nitrogen transformations following land application. Carbon dioxide emissions are also generated through biological decomposition and energy use.

        <h3>Management strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Practices such as anaerobic digestion, solid–liquid separation, composting, storage covers, and optimized application timing can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or shift them across the manure management system. The effectiveness of each strategy depends on system context and interactions with nutrient management.

        <h3>Whole-system evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          Our research emphasizes whole-farm and life-cycle perspectives to avoid unintended tradeoffs. We evaluate climate impacts alongside nutrient losses, air quality, water quality, and economic performance to support climate-smart manure management decisions.
